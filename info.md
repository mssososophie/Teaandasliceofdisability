This project has certainly been a journey. Below is the R&D on this project. We are still developing the website and constructing the layers of the first Podcast.

We came together as part of Manchester International Festival Creative 20. As an artist collective we were commissioned to explore digital technology in the arts, and create a response to a work being produced at the festival.
Clare Mc Nulty, ,Sophie and myself Natalie Amber, a mix of disabled and non disabled artists, gravited to Claire Cunningham, who is an amazing disabled dancer, that refuses to conform to the norms of contemporary dance. She is interested in non-normative bodies and keen to highlight the enrichment to be gained in contemporary performance, especially dance,by embracing this. By extension she is also driven to make work that will attract those often disenfranchised from watching contemporary dance due to the conventional body aesthetics or because of the seeming abstractness of dance. Her interest in combining artforms stems from this intention. You can find Claire on twitter @clairecprojects.

As three creatives who like a challenge the ideology of 'Normal' we wanted to find a creative way to tackle the taboos around disability. Bring everyone into the conversation, and provide a platform for people to ask things that they would ordinarily shy away from asking.

A podcast series seemed the perfect avenue to venture down, as we can make the audience very much part of our fabric and conversation.

As three podcast virgins, we have no blueprint to work off, which fits us like a glove, if there is one thing we don't do it's "NORMAL'. We are going to mix the format up, sometimes broadcasting live through Instagram chat, so the audience can participate and post questions, as well as posting regular blogs, and hosting people's stories.
Our audience is at our core, from 16yrs to 122yrs. As this is about bringing disability out of the closet and into the mainstream. We want to encourage people to post comments, email us about their own experiences, or topics they want us to cover.

The challenge to all of us, was to upskill and learn how to deliver all of the above. 









MEET THE TEAM :




Natalie Amber: 
I am an actress and dancer, and all round creative. I have a passion about the human condition which come through in most of the work I create. I also love music, play the flute and teaching myself a few other instruments. I am just about to start level 3 BSL. Making the arts accessible for all  is a big part of what I do, as going to the theatre or watching TV  should not be for the privileged. Once we have secured funding, our end game is to make the podcasts as accessible as possible. So they will be transcribed, and we are exploring ways to make a BSL video of the podcasts.
Outside the arts, I love fashion and colour. And a huge animal lover and all round crazy person. I am neurodiverse, suffer with mental health and have a very dysfunctional body. I have been in a wheelchair for 9yrs, and gone through nearly every stage of mobility. I have severe chronic pain and a catheter, which comes into its own at times. The way I view things is all the above is just part of me. It doesn't define me.

Clare McNulty: 
I am a neurodiverse artist and performer. I focus on the beauty in difference through my queer and vaired practice. This Podcast is one branch of that, grown in Manchester International Festival's creative lab.
I have what people call 'Invisible disability, because i am not in a wheelchair or visibly disabled. I try not to walk with aids where possible due to the fact the A: I have not found one stylish enough yet
B: Sticks i struggle to hold
C:They don't' really help me balance, and I wouldn't want a stranger right to tell me I look drunk away!
Conversation is key to positive change. We want the stigma and Stereotyping and othering of minorities to stop.

Sophie Ashcroft. : 
I work as a creative technologist, UX researcher, and design A11y champion. I’m proud to be the technical lead for Tea and a Slice of Disability, I feel it’s so important to platform the often untold stories from this community of often marginalised people.
As the non disabled member of T&SD you’ll often hear me asking how people like myself can do better and I’ll also be asking deeper questions on how we could or should design better products, experiences, or places for disabled people.



However the journey of setting this up has been a roller coaster itself. We wanted to launch with the biggest taboo that is out there, Sex. When it comes to talking openly about sex, as a nation we are still a bit reserved. So throw disability into the mix, everyone runs for the hills, well unless they are a devote, or have a wheelchair fetish.

Now we are quite well versed when it comes to this topic, between Sophie being a sex tech hacker, Clare being a dominatrix, who's MS gets exaspersted by vibraters and myself who has to be really inventive when it comes to any of it.
Our first interview we went straight to the source, and interview a sex toy and aid company. All was going so well, until the owner laid bare a scandal attached to the shop that, on an ethical level we didn't want to be associated with. Maybe it was a silver lining as we made our first epic mistake. Despite the fact I tested the microphone and the sound levels. At some point in the interview the microphone cable had been knocked. So nothing was recorded. First Lesson on the day, always record a back up!
But we had a fleet of shops in our arsenal, so spared no time and contact Love Honey. They were really receptive, wanted to be part of the conversation, after a bit of chasing we had a date set. With the deadline of our first episode looming, we discovered out next obstacle, finding an accessible recording studio or small room to hold a skype interview. Mission impossible, unless you have a lot of cash to part with. But hey we don't do convention, so if the sound is not perfect, sod it, lets just call it part of the ambience.
Well of course, with only 4 days until our deadline, it would be too simple for everything to be smooth sailing. The afternoon before the interview, to be courteous we sent Love Honey a rough guide to the questions we were going to ask. I have to add, we had already discussed the topic with them. Within 15mins they emailed back, not phoned. To say they no longer had anyone free to speak to us, but good luck with the project????? What the F£@k!!! Now to give a bit of context, Love Honey have their own podcast series, who have never mentioned disability. Mmmm.......... let's take a guess that an episode on disability is their next podcast??

So no, we didn't meet our deadline. So currently the podcast sound bite below is still a work in progress and not the final episode.
However, I am a believer that things happen for a reason. Through the failings of Love Honey we found Uber Kinky, who markets both to the mainstream and the fetish. Started by an incredible woman in the late 80's, their ethos is, that as long as its consensual and safe, a healthy sex life in its many forms is for everyone to enjoy. I won't say much more, as you can find out more about Uber Kinky in the Sex Blog. Of course even that interview had teething issues with the sound. But nothing is solution free. And we are lucky enough to have been invited to go to Uber Kinky’s head quarters next week, to do the interview live. 

I (Natalie Amber) took the lead on creating the website. I have to say, as someone who struggles to attach documents to emails, this was a little brave, and really naive. Mainly because i thought i could create it in a day. Mmm… roll on two weeks, and it’s still in development. There is a reason I am creative lead and not the technical lead. The link to the website is below, so please feel free to explore. Just a nugget to bare in mind, I am neurodiverse and  I have yet to spell check any of it. The next stage is to make the format cleaner, so it's easy to view with a screen reader.

The Link below leads you to a taster of our first podcast. The whole episode is still being edited and constructed. We have a few guest features to add in. We are hoping to have the first episode go live by the end of July. If you follow us on Twitter or Instagram, we will send out a link. It will be hosted on  Itunes and Spotify.   http://Www.soundcloud.com/teaandasliceofdisability 

We are excited about what lies in the future of Tea and a Slice of Disability. I am sure there will be plenty of more high's and low's. But we are here to take you on the ride with us!
